= Rules for the War =

  * Attack frequency
  Each clan can attack any territory with at least one side in common with a territory that they control, once per day.

  * Simultaneous attacks
  A Clan with more than one territory under attack can defer a match as much as one week between matches at their will, or an undefined amount of time if both, the attacker and the defender agree. The system must provide a mechanism to allow this communications between clans.

  * Match deadline
  Once a match is scheduled, any team must notify its absence at least two hours before the match. Failing to do this implies a free victory for the other team. The system must provide an automatic notification mechanism to remind clan managers to attend the match or notify their absence.


= Rules for each Battle =

  * time for matches
    * minimum time (to allow teams to prepare for the match)
    Each match should be announced with enough time for both teams to prepare a roster (days?). This time starts to count after the attacked team recieves an attack notification.
    * maximum time
    The attacked team will be able delay the match for one week without agreement or for longer times if both clans agree. The system must provide a mechanism to allow clan managers to comunicate this decisions to other clans.

  * map-choice
  A fixed map will be choosen based on the territory being attacked.
