#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design
Index of requirements that the site will or should be having.

Post here anything that you think the application will need in form of an abstract description, a sketch (diagram or handrawn) or any reasonable way of clearly expressing your ideas, trying to avoid technical details. Long items like sketches or samples should be in a separate page with a link and optionally an description here.


== Functional requirements ==
Post here requirements about the working of the site. i.e.:
_The system must have a way to let the users register themselves_:.


----

== Non functional requirements ==
Post here any requirements that have nothing to do with the things that the system should do itself. i.e.:
_The system must have a reasonable uptime_ (very bad example, think of anything that we can't implement ourselves like system conditions, client browser support, etc...)
