#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design
Index of requirements that the site will or should be having.

Post here anything that you think the application will need in form of an abstract description, a sketch (diagram or handrawn) or any reasonable way of clearly expressing your ideas, trying to avoid technical details. Long items like sketches or samples should be in a separate page with a link and optionally an description here.


== Functional requirements ==
Post here requirements about the working of the site. i.e.:
_The system must have a way to let the users register themselves_:.

- user management:
 - registering accounts
 - changing details (password, etc)
 - deleting accounts

- clan management:
 - "importing" a clan (script will check http://clan.savage2clans.com/roster.php and get all the members)

- match management:
 - choosing a target to attack
 - hinting players on how to set up a match
 - getting the results of a match (merc might provide us xml-data)

- war/map management:
 - possibility to view the map (public)

----

== Non functional requirements ==
Post here any requirements that have nothing to do with the things that the system should do itself. i.e.:
_The system should recieve player stats and clan info from an official s2 source_ (think of anything that we can't implement ourselves like system conditions, client browser support, etc... but we will have to manage in some way)
