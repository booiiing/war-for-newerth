#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design
Index of requirements that the site will or should be having.

Post here anything that you think the application will need in form of an abstract description, a sketch (diagram or handrawn) or any reasonable way of clearly expressing your ideas, trying to avoid technical details. Long items like sketches or samples should be in a separate page with a link and optionally an description here.
