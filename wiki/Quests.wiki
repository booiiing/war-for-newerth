#Ingame Quests for clans

= Is that possible? =

I saw this thread http://forums.savage2.com/showthread.php?t=17276
and that sounds an awesome idea.
Im pretty sure it possible to make custom maps with quests for clans to make it.
Lets say like Epic bosses etc, when clan have to go trough huge map full with NPCs and kill the final boss for achivment.
