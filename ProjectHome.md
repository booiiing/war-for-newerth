# Wellcome to War for Newerth #
War for Newerth is a clan gaming league based in a Fight for Territories idea for [Savage 2: A tortured soul](http://www.savage2.com/en/).

Each clan is given an undefined number of territories on a virtual map. Each territory is represented by an in-game map that will be used as battelfield.

Each turn, the clans owning territory can fight each other for a single neighbouring territory by their own or forming alliances with other clans.
